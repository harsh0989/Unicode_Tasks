                Hey guys my name is Harsh Mangukiya. This is the first blog on my page. I started coding recently and I
                find it very interesting and I am always excited to work on projects.These projects that I have made
                might not be so good to look at, however I am looking forward to improve
                myself and keep up with what all is necessary. I want to join Unicode to to experiece what it is to work
                with a team on a certain projects.

                It has been a year since I am in DJ Sanghvi and in this year I have made many friends. We have met a
                couple of times and enjoyed everytime. Here is a moment we captured when we met a friend's house. So
                meet my friends. They are so called "YOUTHOOBERS"

                In conclusion I would like to say that I am really grateful to Unicode as I got a chance to start my
                coding journey, looking forward to learn more and more.
